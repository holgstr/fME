# **`fme`**: Forward Marginal Effects <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The `fme` package implements [forward marginal effects (FMEs)][1], a new model-agnostic interpretation method for feature effects in machine learning models. FMEs are conceptually simple and intuitive to work with - we explain [here][3] why you should use them. Currently, `fme` supports binary classification and regression models included in the [caret][4] and [mlr3][2] libraries. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install directly from GitHub:
library(devtools)
install_github("holgstr/fme")
```

## Quickstart

An in-depth tutorial to the package can be found [here](https://holgstr.github.io/fme/articles/fme.html). One advantage of FMEs is that the way they are interpreted is similar to beta coefficients in simple linear regression models. Consider the following example: how does an increase in temperature by 1°C affect bike rentals (`count`)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(fme)
library(mlr3verse)
data(bikes)
forest = lrn("regr.ranger")$train(as_task_regr(x = bikes, id = "bikes", target = "count"))
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Compute and plot FMEs for a model like this:
effects = fme(model = forest,
              data = bikes,
              target = "count",
              feature = "temp",
              step.size = 1)
plot(effects, jitter = c(0.2, 0))
```

On average, an increase in temperature by 1°C can be expected to raise the predicted number of bikes rentals by more than 2.
