# **`fme`**: Forward Marginal Effects <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

This package implements [forward marginal effects (FMEs)][1], a new model-agnostic framework for interpreting feature effects in machine learning models. FMEs are the simplest and most intuitive way to interpret feature effects - we explain [here][3] how they are computed and why you should use them. Currently, `fme` supports regression and (binary) classification models included in the [caret][4] and [mlr3][2] libraries. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install directly from GitHub:
library(devtools)
install_github("holgstr/fme")
```

## Quickstart

See [here][5] for an in-depth tutorial. The big advantage of FMEs is that they are interpreted similar to beta coefficients in linear regression models. Consider the following example: how does an increase in temperature (`temp`) by 1°C affect bike rentals (`count`)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(fme)
library(mlr3verse)
data(bikes)
forest = lrn("regr.ranger")$train(as_task_regr(x = bikes, id = "bikes", target = "count"))
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Compute and plot FMEs for a model like this:
effects = fme(model = forest,
              data = bikes,
              target = "count",
              feature = "temp",
              step.size = 1)
plot(effects, jitter = c(0.2, 0))
```

On average, an increase in temperature by 1°C can be expected to raise the predicted number of bikes rentals by more than 2. This is called the average marginal effect (AME).

Let's compute the AME for each feature of the model:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Compute and plot FMEs for a model like this:
ame(model = forest,
    data = bikes,
    target = "count")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ame(model = forest,
    data = bikes,
    target = "count")
```
