# **`fme`**: Forward Marginal Effects <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The `fme` package implements [forward marginal effects (FMEs)][1], a model-agnostic method for interpreting feature effects in supervised machine learning models. Currently, we support regression models included in the [mlr3 framework][2]. We are working to extend it to binary classification. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install directly from GitHub:
library(devtools)
install_github("holgstr/fme")
```

## Usage

A introduction can be found [here](https://holgstr.github.io/fme/articles/fme.html). The main function to compute FMEs is `fme()`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(fme)
library(mlr3verse)
data(bikes)
forest = lrn("regr.ranger")$train(as_task_regr(x = bikes, id = "bikes", target = "count"))
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Run once to configure your package to use pkgdown
effects = fme(model = forest,
              data = bikes,
              target = "count",
              feature = "temp",
              step.size = 1)
plot(effects, jitter = c(0.2, 0))
```
