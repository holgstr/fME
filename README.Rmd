# **`fmeffects`**: An R Package for Forward Marginal Effects <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

This package implements [forward marginal effects (FMEs)][1], a model-agnostic framework for interpreting feature effects in machine learning models. FMEs are the simplest and most intuitive way to interpret feature effects - we explain [here][3] how they are computed and why they should be preferred to existing methods. Currently, `fmeffects` supports 100+ regression and (binary) classification models:

* All models from the [tidymodels][6], [mlr3][2] and [caret][4] libraries.
* Native support for `lm`-type models, e.g. `glm` or `gam`.

## Installation

**CRAN:** 

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("fmeffects")
```

**GitHub:** 

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("holgstr/fmeffects")
```

## Quickstart

See [here][5] for an in-depth tutorial. The big advantage of FMEs is that they are interpreted similar to beta coefficients in linear regression models. Consider the following example: how does an increase in temperature (`temp`) by 1°C affect bike rentals (`count`)?

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(fmeffects)
data(bikes)
```

### Train a Model

#### `tidymodels`

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Train a model with tidymodels:
library(tidymodels)
forest <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("ranger")
forest <- forest %>% fit(count ~ ., data = bikes)
```

#### `mlr3`

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Train a model with mlr3:
library(mlr3verse)
task <- as_task_regr(x = bikes, target = "count")
forest <- lrn("regr.ranger")$train(task)
```

### Compute effects

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
effects <- fme(model = forest,
              data = bikes,
              features = list(temp = 1))
summary(effects)
```

### Plot effects

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot(effects)
```

On average, an increase in temperature by 1°C results in an increase in the predicted number of bike rentals by more than 56. This is called the average marginal effect (AME).

### Model Overview

Let's compute the AME for every feature of the model:

```{r}
overview <- ame(model = forest,
                data = bikes)
summary(overview)
```
