# **`fmeffects`**: An R Package for Forward Marginal Effects <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

This package implements [forward marginal effects (FMEs)][1], a model-agnostic framework for interpreting feature effects in machine learning models. FMEs are the simplest and most intuitive way to interpret feature effects - we explain [here][3] how they are computed and why they should be preferred to existing methods. Currently, `fmeffects` supports 100+ regression and (binary) classification models:

* All models from the [tidymodels][6], [mlr3][2] and [caret][4] libraries.
* Additionally, native support for generalized linear models (`glm`) & generalized additive models (`mgcv::gam`).

## Installation

### Release

You can install the current release version from *CRAN* with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("fmeffects")
```

### Development

You can install the current development version from *Github* with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("holgstr/fmeffects")
```

## Quickstart

See [here][5] for an in-depth tutorial. The big advantage of FMEs is that they are interpreted similar to beta coefficients in linear regression models. Consider the following example: how does an increase in temperature (`temp`) by 1°C affect bike rentals (`count`)?

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Train a random forest on the 'bikes' data using mlr3:
set.seed(123)
library(fmeffects)
library(mlr3verse)
data(bikes)
task = as_task_regr(x = bikes, id = "bikes", target = "count")
forest = lrn("regr.ranger")$train(task)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Compute effects for a trained model 'forest':
effects = fme(model = forest,
              data = bikes,
              feature = "temp",
              step.size = 1)
plot(effects, jitter = c(0.2, 0))
```

On average, an increase in temperature by 1°C results in an increase in the predicted number of bike rentals by more than 2. This is called the average marginal effect (AME).

Let's compute the AME for every feature of the model:

```{r}
# Compute AMEs with default step sizes:
overview = ame(model = forest,
               data = bikes)
summary(overview)
